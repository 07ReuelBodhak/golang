# Interface

Interfaces in Go are a powerful feature that allows you to define behavior without specifying how the behavior is implemented. They are a key part of Go's type system and enable polymorphism, making it easier to write flexible and reusable code.

```go
type InterfaceName interface{
    method1(param1,param2) ReturnType,
    method2() ReturnType
}
```

## Empty Interface

The empty interface interface{} is a special case in Go. It has zero methods and is satisfied by any type, making it similar to Object in other languages. Itâ€™s often used when the exact type of the value is not known ahead of time.

```go
func Describe(i interface{}){
    fmt.Printf("(%v, %T)\n", i, i)
}

func main() {
    Describe(42)         // Output: (42, int)
    Describe("hello")    // Output: (hello, string)
    Describe(true)       // Output: (true, bool)
}
```

## Type Assertions and Type Switches

When you have a value of an interface type, you can use a type assertion to extract its underlying concrete type. Here's how you do it:

```go
var i interface{} = "hello"

s, ok := i.(string)
if ok {
    fmt.Println(s)
}else{
    fmt.Println("i is not a string")
}
```

For multiple types, you can use a type switch:

```go
switch v := i.(type) {
case string:
    fmt.Println("i is a string:", v)
case int:
    fmt.Println("i is an int:", v)
default:
    fmt.Printf("i is of type %T\n", v)
}

```
